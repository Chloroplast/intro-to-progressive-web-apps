# intro-to-progressive-web-apps
This repository is designed to introduce developers to progressive web applications and the underlying concepts. 

To get started, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Chloroplast/intro-to-progressive-web-apps/wiki)

## Running the Demo App
1. run `npm install`

1. run `npm run-script build`

1. run `serve -s build`

1. in another tab, run `node server.js`

The app will be available at `localhost:5000` with the server listening on port 8080. 

**As a reminder, this app is not supposed to be an example of best practices. It is a quick example of how a PWA works. There are many things that could be improved.**
